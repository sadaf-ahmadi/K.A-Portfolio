          <p className="lead mb-3">
            I'm Kourosh, an Assistant Project Manager at EllisDon with a passion for precision, planning, and innovation in the construction industry.
            With over 4 years of experience leading large-scale commercial builds, I thrive in environments where detail and structure meet creativity.
          </p>
          <p className="lead mb-3">
            I bring a strong mix of field expertise and client relationship skills to every project.
            Whether I'm on-site coordinating subcontractors or meeting with stakeholders, I strive to bring vision to reality.
            Outside of work, Iâ€™m often on the tennis court, exploring new places around the city, or offering guidance to junior engineers getting started in the industry.
